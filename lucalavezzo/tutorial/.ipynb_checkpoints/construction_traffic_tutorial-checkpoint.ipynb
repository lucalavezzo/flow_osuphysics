    "# Construction Zone Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks you through the process of setting up a SUMO simulation in the Flow environment and the training of RL agents. Other tutorials work through certain parts of building an experiment, but this tutorial aims to go into further depth into some of details and hopes to more concrete examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The experiment\n",
    "The experiment consists of a highway with an inflow of human vehicles with multiple lanes, which encounters a 'contruction zone' where the lanes reduce to just one. The RL agents, looping over a portion of the highway along the construction zone, will be trained to control the multiple lanes of human vehicles in order to improve the mean speed of the human vehicles through this obstacle - and hence incease the rate of flow.\n",

    "## 2. The Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training the RL agents, we should test the simulation of the human agents on the network you designed. We can add the RL agents with human controllers to test whether the parts that we don't intend to control in the training work as well (e.g. we can start assigning the RL agents their routes and testing them, since we don't intend to control those in the training).\n",

    "\n",
    "Before adding them to the network, each class of vehicles and their parameters need to be defined.\n",

    "Here we add a class of RL vehicles and a class of human vehicles, the __controllers__ regulate:\n",
    "- acceleration\n",
    "- lane chanigng\n",
    "- the routes that the vehicles will take\n",
    "- how they will follow other cars\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow provides some contorllers in flow/flow/controllers/, which we will use and modify. Tweak these to obtain whichever behavior you want from the vehicles.In the training, we will replace the controller of the RL vehicle with the trainable environment, which will act as the controller for the RL agent.\n",
