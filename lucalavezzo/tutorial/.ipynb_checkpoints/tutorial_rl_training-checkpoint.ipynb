    "### 4.4 The Reward Function\n",
    "We are now collecting the state of the network and its vehicles at each time step and we defined the possible actions that the Rl agents can take, we need to define a __reward function__ that the training will be based on.<br>\n",
    "This is another place where one can affect the training by prioritizing certain behvaiovrs and punishing others.<br>\n",
    "Three specific features are taken into account in this reward function:\n",
    "1. Mean speed of the human vehicles in the edges preceding the construction zone.\n",
    "2. The acceleration of the RL agents.\n",
    "3. The number of vehicles not moving.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inclusion of the first parameter is to encourage the increase of the mean velocity of the human cars on the highway where the construction zone causes the slowdown. Since the RL agents will be rewarded based on the magnitude of this number, they will try to increase it.<br>\n",
    "The acceleration of the RL agents is also rewarded because we want them to be driving as fast as possible when they can. This encourages them to keep going if they have the space to.<br>\n",
    "The penalization of the standstill similiarly punsishes the training by returning a negative number calculated by the number of vehicles that aren't moving in the edges before the consturction zone.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the parameters are multiplied by a specific gain, and everything is normalized to be in (0,1). By changing the gains we can control how each parameter affects the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other sample reward functions are included in /flow/core/rewards.py"
